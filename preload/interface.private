-- SB2 preload library: interface to external functions
-- ====================================================
--
-- This file defines symbols that are called from the SB2 preload
-- library, but not exported to the application. The idea is not
-- to change the functionality of these functions, but instead
-- this interface specification tries to protect against 
-- side-effects that are caused by name space pollution:
--
-- Wrappers are used for these functions, so that the functions
-- can be guaranteed to be called from lower-level libraries
-- (=glibc) and not from the application. Some application
-- binaries introduce functions with identical names 
-- (which is a very bad practise, but at least "bash"
-- has done so: it has private versions of getenv(),
-- unsetenv(), etc...use "nm" to find out the ugly details)
--
-- Syntax of this file is explained in "gen-interface.pl".
