scratchbox2 (2.3.90) unstable; urgency=low

  * No changes to the SW; instead, this version can be considered 
    to be the first release candidate for SB2 version 2.4!
  * Added source of the arch.document (Scratchbox 2 Internals
    and Architecture)

scratchbox2 (2.3.63) unstable; urgency=low

  * Implemented resolution of symbolic links inside
    simulated chroots (absolute symlinks, relative
    symlinks were mostly ok already in 2.3.62)
  * obs-rpm-* modes import /dev and /proc rules
    from the rule library
  * new experimental mapping modes obs-deb-install
    and obs-deb-build; these haven't been tested yet
    and almost certainly will need some tuning.
  * New flag for rules: force_orig_path_unless_chroot
  * Library interface version = 130

scratchbox2 (2.3.62) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial support for simulating chroot() (ordinary files
    and directories should be OK, but symlinks are not yet
    expected to work correctly in the simulated chroot)
  * Library interface version = 129

scratchbox2 (2.3.58-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bugfix: Fixed handling of target-specific LD_PRELOAD
    and LD_LIBRARY_PATH (those can now be set by e.g.
    "sb2-config setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ...")

 -- Lauri T. Aarnio <lauri.aarnio@iki.fi>  Wed, 16 May 2012 18:24:00 +0300

scratchbox2 (2.3.57-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * More enhancements to exec functionalty [from Mika Westerberg]
  * Added support for FS rule libraries [Lauri Aarnio]
  * "emulate" mode now imports rules for /dev and /sys
    from the rule library
  * A new rule for /sys/fs/selinux is supposed to hide selinux from
    the target side (in emulate mode), and that way should fix the
    problems caused by a active selinux on the host side.
  * libsb2.so is not linked with -lm anymore

scratchbox2 (2.3.56-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Various fixes and enhancements for host-compatible
    targets (i.e. when compiling for intel targets on
    an intel host) [from Mika Westerberg]
  * "emulate" mode: Fixes to /dev mapping rules (e.g.
    "echo >/dev/null" works again with "sb2 -e", and
    not only when "sb2 -eR" is used) [Lauri Aarnio]

  * more /dev fixes for the "emulate" mode
  * an additional trick for supporting debootrapping (see
    full comment in the "sb2" script)

 -- Lauri T. Aarnio <lauri.aarnio@iki.fi>  Thu, 19 Apr 2012 19:58:00 +0300

scratchbox2 (2.3.53-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New manual page libsb2_interface(7), generated automatically
    from interface.master
  * fixes for /proc and /dev; "emulate" mode now allows simulated 
    devices to be created under /dev
  * Library interface version = 128
  * Improved checking of rules at startup, refuses to start up if
    there were errors
  * A change to mapping rule format:
    Rules which may not have a valid selector ('dir', 'prefix'
    or 'path' may be nil) need to be marked with 'optional_rule = true'
    (fs_rules: rule_file_interface_version = "105" now). Failing to
    do so will generate warnings to sb2d's log. In the future that
    will be an error which will prevent startup. 
  * + other small fixes.

scratchbox2 (2.3.51-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bugfix to native static binary exec code
  * sb2-show: Removed command "execluafile" and options -x and -X
  * Moved some obsolete C and Lua files to unsupported/obsolete

 -- Lauri T. Aarnio <lauri.aarnio@iki.fi>  Tue, 10 Apr 2012 17:57:00 +0300

scratchbox2 (2.3.50-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * No more Lua in libsb2. Lua is now used only in sb2d.
    The runtime "core" of Scratchbox 2 operates now completely
    without the Lua interpreter. Lua is used at session setup
    time from sb2d, but after that, Lua is inactive.
  * All parts of exec postprocessing are now implemented in C,
    except one which was disabled: sbrsh is not anymore available
    as a CPU transparency method.
  * Qemu is the only supported CPU transparency method currently;
    regardless of what has been configured with sb2-init, libsb2
    assumes it is Qemu.
  * The old Lua-related files are still there, and there is 
    dead code in the C files, too. Those are now waiting for a
    bigger cleanup.

 -- Lauri T. Aarnio <lauri.aarnio@iki.fi>  Thu, 05 Apr 2012 17:51:00 +0300

scratchbox2 (2.3.49-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Adapted the host-static-binaries-with-Qemu feature [from
    Rafal Krypa, for the 2.2 version] for 2.3; the code is
    now there, but haven't been fully tested yet.
  * A new internal tool, sb2dctl, for sending messages to sb2d
    (used for intelnal purposes)
  * Introduced init2.lua, which is executed by sb2d when
    finilizing session setup. It is used for loading CPU 
    transparency settings to the rule tree (those
    variables are now loaded to the rule tree, but not yet
    used for anything)

scratchbox2 (2.3.47-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * "intermediate cleanup release": Fixed compiler warnings,
    rule tree DB header was changed, etc, but no real
    functional changes.

 -- Lauri T. Aarnio <lauri.aarnio@iki.fi>  Wed, 21 Mar 2012 14:27:00 +0200

scratchbox2 (2.3.46-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The rule tree DB is now completely initialized by sb2d
    (the "sb2" command does not anymore execute any Lua files
    with "sb2-show execluafile")
  * Exec code: Postrocessing of dynamically linked native
    binaries is now implemented in C (old code (Lua 
    function sb_execve_postprocess_native_executable())
    is still there, but not used.)

 -- Lauri T. Aarnio <lauri.aarnio@iki.fi>  Tue, 20 Mar 2012 16:48:00 +0200

scratchbox2 (2.3.45-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Exec code: Script interpreter mapping is now implemented 
    in C (Lua code was removed), complete exec policies are 
    added to the role tree db, etc. Also, there are related 
    changes in other subsystems (pathmapping, etc)
  * C/Lua interface version = 122

 -- Lauri T. Aarnio <lauri.aarnio@iki.fi>  Fri, 16 Mar 2012 13:51:00 +0200

scratchbox2 (2.3.43-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Better simulation of root's privileges in open(), fopen(), etc:
    The simulated root user can now write to write-protected files,
    and read read-protected files (if file owner == real EUID)
  * Added wrapper for dup3()
  * A bugfix to real_fstatat()

 -- Lauri T. Aarnio <lauri.aarnio@iki.fi>  Fri, 09 Mar 2012 13:52:00 +0200

scratchbox2 (2.3.42-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * "C" is now the default mapping strategy
    (used to be "Both", i.e. mapped with both C and Lua.
    see "README_2.3_development" for details)
  * two auto-generated config files are now created by sb2d,
    instead of creating them expilicitly at "sb2" (argvmods_misc.lua,
    argvmods_gcc.lua)
  * Added manual page sb2d.1
  * sb2 command: New option -x for specifying options for sb2d

 -- Lauri T. Aarnio <lauri.aarnio@iki.fi>  Wed, 07 Mar 2012 12:14:00 +0200

scratchbox2 (2.3.41-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fakeroot has been eliminated; A built-in virtual permissions
    ("Vperm") subsystem superseded it. See the manual page for details.
  * A fix to the "ldd" wrapper [from Florent Viard] (ldd
    is now wrapped in the "simple" mode, too)

 -- Lauri T. Aarnio <lauri.aarnio@iki.fi>  Mon, 05 Mar 2012 17:34:00 +0200

scratchbox2 (2.3.29-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Important change to command-line parameter handling:
    the "sb2" command now prevents re-evaluation of command
    line parameters which are passed to the commands running
    inside the session. It also preserves whitespace in such
    parameters (previously, an extra shell was used there,
    but that has been eliminated completely now)
  * Important change to rule file format:
    func_class (a bitmask) replaced func_name (a regexp)
    in path mapping rules
  * C/Lua interface version = 120

 -- Lauri T. Aarnio <lauri.aarnio@iki.fi>  Tue, 14 Feb 2012 18:27:00 +0200

scratchbox2 (2.3.27-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * All modes which use the cross-toolchain support: Redirect /usr/bin/cc
    to /usr/bin/gcc, if the toolchain does not have "cc" command (this
    now happens at exec preprocessing stage)

 -- Lauri T. Aarnio <lauri.aarnio@iki.fi>  Tue, 07 Feb 2012 15:40:00 +0200

scratchbox2 (2.3.26-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * An important bugfix to uname() for 64 bit systems
  * Log format changed (no more pretty timestamps,
    to avoid possible deadlocks inside glibc)
  * Fixes to obs-rpm-build* modes
  * + other minor fixes.

 -- Lauri T. Aarnio <lauri.aarnio@iki.fi>  Wed, 01 Feb 2012 18:13:00 +0200

scratchbox2 (2.3.24-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * sb2d adds exec preprocssing rules ("argvmods" rules) to
    the rule tree when a session is created; loading of exec
    preprocessing rules (Lua) is skipped if it isn't needed
  * some code reorganizations; exec logic is now in a new
    subdirectory.
  * C/Lua interface version = 97

    the rule tree..but more will follow)
  * C pathmapping: Avoid fallbacks to Lua mapping
  * Slightly more efficient rule tree lookups
  * Added routines to measure and log time spent in selected 
    routines ("processclock" feature, disabled by default, can be
    enabled from main Makefile)

 -- Lauri T. Aarnio <lauri.aarnio@iki.fi>  Sat, 28 Jan 2012 17:01:00 +0200

scratchbox2 (2.3.22-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Performance improvements to Lua code, including a relatively
    big change to exec logic initialization: Mapping code is not
    always loaded (especailly when SBOX_MAPPING_METHOD=C is used)
  * All modes must now a have a "config.lua" file
  * Rule file interface version = 102
  * C/Lua interface version = 96
  * A bugfix to logger

scratchbox2 (2.3.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The new mapping engine, written in C, should be complete now.
    (No more voluntary fallbacks to Lua mapping). Still,
    Mapping method can be selected by setting SBOX_MAPPING_METHOD
    to "C", "Lua" or "Both". Default is "Both".

scratchbox2 (2.3.5-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * A new mapping engine, written in C, has been added.
    It handles most mapping rules, but still fallbacks to
    Lua mapping in some cases (e.g. union directories,
    func_name requirements). Mapping method can be
    selected by setting SBOX_MAPPING_METHOD to "C",
    "Lua" or "Both". Default is "Both"; different mapping
    results will be logged as warnings.

scratchbox2 (2.3.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added networking subsystem: Networking mode can be specified
    with an option (e.g. "sb2 -n offline"), the subsystem filters
    and rewrites IPv4 addresses if needed. (IPv6 is not yet
    supported). "Standard" networking modes include "online",
    "offline", "localhost" and "online_privatenets".

scratchbox2 (2.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low
  
  [ Lauri Aarnio ]
  * NOTE: this is the first usable test version in the 2.3-development
    series; this is still alpha-level quality, and even if it seems
    to work quite well in my test environment, more testing is 
    still needed.
  * Highlights of the changes:
  - "accel" mode replaced "devel" mode. Both names can be used,
    but they refer to the same thing.
  - "install" and "maemo_simple" modes were removed; these have not
    been maintained since 2009, as far as I know. Please let us know
    if these are still needed for something.
  - Added proto-level support for union directories; added some
    rules to the accel/devel mode that will use union directories
    for aclocal and pkg-config (making an union from selected subdirs
    from the target- and tools directories).
  - Mapping modes were reorganized; rule files were split to two
    parts (separate files for pathmapping- and exec policy rules),
    and other mode-specific configuration files were moved, too.
  - There are changes to the mapping rule format; The new one is
    simpler and makes some planned future enhancements possible.
    Most notably, the old "chains" layer was eliminated completely
    from pathmapping rules.
  - There are some cleanups and code reorganizations in the "engine
    room" as well. In particular, the pathmapping code (in C) was moved
    to a new subdirectory and split to modules (one file/module).

  [ Lauri Aarnio ]
  * One new feature: sb2-logz can create process and exec diagrams
    (graphs); execute "sb2-logz -h" for details.
  * external_patches: patches for eglibc2.10 are available now
    (see external_patches/README)
  * Fix: Better protection of "errno" in certain situations
  * Fixes to CPU transparency method handling: Consistency checks,
    and options can now be passed to the transparency method (e.g. qemu)
  * Fix to toolchain (gcc) config: Fixed detection of 
    -Wno-poison-system-directories
  * other, minor bugfixes were included as well.

  [ Mike McCormack ]
  * Fix: Added wrappers for mkstemps64() and mkstemps() (this fixes mapping
    of tmp.files created by mkstemps(); at least some newer versions 
    of gcc use it)
