llbuild guide
*************

Let's assume you have following directory structure:

project/
	include/
	src/
	src/subsystem1
	src/sybsystem2


* install the llbuild directory to project/llbuild
* copy project/llbuild/Makefile.toplevel-sample to project/Makefile
* create subdir Makefiles using project/llbuild/Makefile.subdir-sample
  as a guideline


llbuild is light weight and tries to avoid creating any unnecessary
cruft on top of make itself. Make is a rather powerful tool if you take
the time to learn it.
