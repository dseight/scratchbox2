Notes about RPM support and RRPM packaging of Scratchbox2
=========================================================

Scratchbox 2 has traditionally been used on debian-based linux systems,
and support for building .deb packages can be considered stable. There has
been some interest in making it available for rpm-based systems, too.

This problem can be divided to two areas:

1. Building RPM package(s) of SB2 itself. There is now a script for
   building installable RPM packages for OpenSUSE; run
	./opensuse_rpm/build_rpms_for_opensuse.sh
   and it will create the .spec file and the .tar.gz files
   to ./packages and execute rpmbuild. Results will be available
   in ./packages/RPMS.
   NOTE: Currently everything goes to a single rpm package,
   unlike the debian packaging, where the libsb2 library is in
   a separate package. This should be fixed (both environments
   should have libsb2 in a separate package, because it enables
   more sensible tools_root configuration)

2. building RPM packages with SB2. Just now there isn't any special
   tricks in the rule files, or any wrappers for rpm tools for the
   more advanced modes (accel). Instead, I have done some preliminary
   build tests by running rpmbuild in the "emulate" mode (which of course
   uses qemu for everything), "emulate+toolchain" mode (new mode which
   uses the configured toolchain - but everything else is still
   executed with qemu) and finally, the new & experimental
   "emulate+toolchain+utils" mode, which maps some selected utilities
   to the host FS. The last one can be considered to be a safer approach
   than the "simple" mode.


-----------------

Support for integration to OBS (openSUSE build system)

Version 2.3.9 added two special-purpose mapping modes:
obs-rpm-install and obs-rpm-build, to be used by the OBS workers.
